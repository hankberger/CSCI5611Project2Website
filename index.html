                            <p>Rope simulation was extended to include horizontal springs, this gives the illusion of cloth being simulated. Cloth parameters were fine-tuned to create a natural swinging motion.</p>

                        <h3>I actually had a lot of trouble with this one. At first, I could not get my math or rendering working at all. I started completely from scratch 4 different times, making it that I was at the complete beginning after working on it for 4 days straight. What helped me out was building out a 2D cloth simulation in processing using the rope code given for one of the in-class activities.</h3>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>One of the biggest challenges I encountered was my simulaiton blowing up on my a ton. This happened no matter how low I set dt to, and no matter what the parameters of my simulation were. I found out this problem was due to my render loop taking an abnormally long time to calculate a few frames, which would lead to a massive dt that blew up my sim. I fixed this by only updating if dt was in a safe range <.5 ms.</h3>
